# Routines
Glyphs come in two types, simple and complex. Glyphs contain information about the points of the original outline as well as other data including instructions that the font engine will need to generate a glyph. Complex glyphs are made up of simple glyphs or other complex glyphs, and for this reason, recursion is necessary in order to process a complex glyph. The font engine calls the setPoints function which gives a glyph table as a parameter. It will call "SimpleGlyphProcess" or "ComplexGlyphProcess" based on the table that was given. If a ComplexGlyphComplex is called, given that one of the parameters is the address of its own function, it will set its local definition of setPoints to that address enabling it to recursively call the function when appropriate.
