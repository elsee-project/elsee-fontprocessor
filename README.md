# Elsee-FontProcessor
Font Processor for integration with Elsee. The font processor takes a .tff font file, dpi and font size as an argument.
It is meant to create characters to be displayed in the document viewer of Elsee any other part of Elsee that has
study content for the user. Currently, this submodule is being built for minimal functionality to process the OpenDyslexia3
.tff file to use as a default font. This minimal functionality was determined by viewing the tables inside of it through use 
of a hex editor.
